3D-printable Astrophotography Electronic Filter Wheel EWF-52 (2" filters x5)

The firmware is based on https://github.com/chemistorge/Arduino-Motorised-Filter-Wheel-Xagyl-compatible-ASCOM-and-INDI-

The electronics is based on ESP32-C3 MCU and the custom board I designed. A small OLED display shows the number of the currently selected filter. 
A cheap 28BYJ-48 stepper motor motorises the wheel.
